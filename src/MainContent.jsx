          <p>With a passion for web development and a global perspective, I'm ready to embark on my journey in the world of coding. Having lived and studied in diverse countries like Malta and Georgia, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to every project.</p>
          <p>As a dedicated developer and product owner, I have the privilege of not only creating but also shaping and guiding the development of user-friendly web and mobile applications. When I'm not coding, you can find me cheering on my three talented swimmers or exploring new destinations with a warm cup of coffee in hand. I'm committed to delivering innovative solutions using tools like Figma, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.</p>
